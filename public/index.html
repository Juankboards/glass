						<p>Human Rights Watch is a nonproft, nongovernmental human rights organization made up of roughly 400 staff 
						members around the globe.<br><br>
						Its staff consists of human rights professionals including country experts, lawyers, journalists, and academics of di-
						verse backgrounds and nationalities. Established in 1978, Human Rights Watch is known for its accurate fact-fnding, 
						impartial reporting, effective use of media, and targeted advocacy, often in partnership with local human rights 
						groups. Each year, <br><br>
						Human Rights Watch publishes more than 100 reports and briefngs on human rights conditions in some 90 coun-
						tries, generating extensive coverage in local and international media. With the leverage this brings, Human Rights 
						Watch meets with governments, the United Nations, regional groups like the African Union and the European Union, 
						fnancial institutions, and corporations to press for changes in policy and practice that promote human rights and 
						justice around the world.
